# This file isolates the definition of which version of Gutenberg to use.
# This way, it can be accessed by multiple sources without duplication.

# Either use commit or tag, if both are left uncommented, tag will take precedence.
#
# If you want to use a local version, please use the LOCAL_GUTENBERG environment variable when calling CocoaPods.
#
# Example:
#
#   LOCAL_GUTENBERG=../my-gutenberg-fork bundle exec pod install
ref:
  # This should have either a commit or tag key.
  # If both are set, tag will take precedence.
  #
  # We have automation that reads and updates this file.
  # Leaving commented keys is discouraged, because as the automation would ignore them and the resulting updates would be noisy
  tag: v1.102.0-alpha1
