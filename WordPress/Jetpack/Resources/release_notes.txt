Version 23.0 is here! Do we look older?

To celebrate, we made design improvements across the app so you can share content on social media more easily. We’re all about that social life.

You’ll notice the new Blaze Campaign card in your dashboard, where you can see the most recent campaign, a campaigns list screen, and a campaign details screen. That’s hot.

We made some Gallery block updates in the block editor.

- We removed the visual gap that appears between selected gallery blocks and the toolbar.
- The gallery caption button is no longer visible on mobile devices.
- The correct gallery block will stay selected while you’re adding media.

You might be happy to hear that we squashed several bugs in the media picker.

- Your screen won’t flash anymore when you open the media picker.
- Media files have stopped rearranging themselves and will now behave.
- The image count no longer includes other media types.
- Thumbnail image sizes are now smaller. Faster loading, less memory—what’s not to love?

We also sped up loading time for the Total Likes stats card and fixed an issue that caused the stats screen to stall the app.

Finally, the app won’t crash when you update notifications, posts, or reader content, or when you’re cleaning up followed topics in the reader. (But wear a helmet anyway. Safety first.)
