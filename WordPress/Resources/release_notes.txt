We’ve made several tweaks to the pre-publishing sheet. You might notice changes like smoother screen transitions, a simplified date picker, and cleaner settings when you’re publishing on your iPad.

We also updated the info section of your user profile that talks about your Gravatar. (Not sure what that is? You’re in for a Grava-treat.)
