We’ve been squashing bugs! (It was a lot cleaner than it sounds.)

- You can now embed URLs from X without getting a broken link. Pretty X-cellent, if you ask us.
- Speaking of links—when you use an invalid media URL, the app will now display an error message instead of crashing. Better, right?
- The compliance (cookies) popover now works properly on small screens using big fonts.
- Contributors will now see the correct pop-up when submitting posts for review. Phew.
- We fixed a problem where non-admin users could see the plugin menu for their site. Out of sight, out of mind.
- In the block editor, the app will no longer crash when you nest too many blocks within blocks… within blocks… you get the idea. Take that, Inception.
