The Stats screen has a new Traffic tab. Get better graphs and access all your historical data in one place. That’s right, you’ve got data for days… and weeks, and months, and years.

Notifications got a glow-up, giving you a shinier, easier-to-use design. We also made a few changes to the block editor.

- We added support for VideoPress v5, so you should notice better performance in your video blocks.
- The app won’t crash anymore when the editor auto-scrolls down to a block. No more giving you up or letting you down.
- You’ll now see an error message when a video fails to upload to media and text blocks.
- Images no longer appear partly transparent while they’re being uploaded. All color, all the time.
