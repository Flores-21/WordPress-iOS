Version 23.0 is here! Do we look older?

To celebrate, we made some Gallery block updates in the block editor.

- We removed the visual gap that appears between selected gallery blocks and the toolbar.
- The gallery caption button is no longer visible on mobile devices.
- The correct gallery block will stay selected while you’re adding media.

We also squashed several bugs in the media picker.

- Your screen won’t flash anymore when you open the media picker.
- Media files have stopped rearranging themselves and will now behave.
- The image count no longer includes other media types.
- Thumbnail image sizes are now smaller. Faster loading, less memory—what’s not to love?

Finally, the app should no longer crash when you update a post. (But wear a helmet anyway. Safety first.)
