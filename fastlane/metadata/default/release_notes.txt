When you move a post to the trash, you’ll now see a confirmation message appear at the bottom of the screen.

We made some changes to the block editor.

- Inactive social icons and Synced Pattern titles are no longer invisible in block-based themes using dark mode. Good try, fellas, but you’re not as ninja as you think.
- In the Classic editor, you can now convert your content into blocks with the click of a button.

Finally, we squashed a mini-swarm of bugs.

- You shouldn’t run into any login issues if you enter the wrong site address on the first try.
- Incorrect HTML tags won’t show up in your post titles—you’ll only see plain text.
- We removed extra controls in the two-factor authentication process that added unnecessary security measures. Logging in is still safe, but now it comes with fewer headaches.
