We’re kicking off version 20 with a fresh new look. The Quick Start card and Next Steps tours now match the new tour designs for existing sites, including a snazzy illustration. High five.

You can now insert images from other websites using the “Insert from URL” option in the app. More cat photos, please.

We’ve made some accessibility improvements in the block editor, so your screen reader offers more of the context you need.

Finally, we took a paintbrush to the media cache, spotlight index, and Siri shortcut functions in App Settings. They now match standard and brand colours—no more panic red.
