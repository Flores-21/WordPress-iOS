Noticed a long delay when saving posts? That might have been because of image, gallery, or file blocks – but not anymore. Saving should be quick and easy, no matter how many photos or files you’ve uploaded.
We also fixed the overlapping “Done” button on the “Post Published” screen. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.
