We fixed a rare bug that made the app crash when binning posts. One person’s rubbish is another person’s… still rubbish, we guess.
We also fixed an issue with the navigation bar in the Post Visibility picker. While we were at it, we updated the editor’s Post Settings screen to use the new navigation bar style. Nice.
