What time is it? Our brand-new time zone selection screen knows. Get a suggested time zone based on your device and improve search while you’re at it.

If you’re using a free plan, video uploads are now limited to five minutes per file. Don’t worry, that won’t affect any videos you’ve already uploaded to your site.

We’ve also made some changes to the block editor:

– We solved translation issues that caused some user interface elements (like text alignment information and the block editor modal window) to only appear in English.
– We added language translation for Jetpack and Layout Grid blocks.
– We fixed a bug that would reset text formatting to default after hitting backspace. Bold on, friends.
– Multi-line block titles are now centre-aligned in the inserter menu.

Finally, the “Share WordPress with a friend” row is back where it belongs on the Me screen. Reunited and it feels so good.
